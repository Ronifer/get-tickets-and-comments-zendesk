# ZENDESK TICKETS AND COMMENTS

Hi! this is a first **alpha beta beta** from this code, but it works, i promisse to refactor this code.


# How it work

The script get all tickets and comments from zendesk api and create 2 files "tickets.csv" and "comments.csv".


## To run the code

 **python 3**

First you need replace in code all <ZENDESK LOGIN> for your user, <ZENDESK PASS> for your password and <ZENDESK URL> for your zendesk url, and finally and run:

    py main.py
